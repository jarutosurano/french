## Gender Tips

!!! tip "How to guess gender"
    There's no perfect rule, but these patterns help:

    **Feminine** — words ending in: **-tion**, **-ée**, **-ance**, **-ence**, **-ure**, **-nuit**

    **Masculine** — words ending in: **-age**, **-ment**, **-it**, **-eau**, **-isme**

## Pronunciation Notes

!!! note "The French \"u\" sound"
    The French **u** (as in *nuit*) doesn't exist in English. Round your lips like you're saying "oo" but try to say "ee" instead. Practice with: *tu*, *rue*, *nuit*, *lune*.

!!! note "Nasal vowels"
    French has nasal vowels where air goes through the nose. In **bon** (bohn), the "n" isn't fully pronounced — it nasalizes the vowel. Same with **non** (nohn).
